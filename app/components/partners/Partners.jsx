            Qiskit is an open-source framework for working with noisy quantum computers at the level of pulses, 
            circuits, and algorithms. It provides tools for creating and manipulating quantum programs and 
            running them on prototype quantum devices on IBM Quantum Experience or on simulators on a local computer.
            Qiskit also enables the user to optimize quantum circuits for a particular device, perform quantum computing 
            experiments on real devices with little effort, and easily access to IBM Quantum hardware through the cloud.
